# Azure DevOps Boards Project Management Tool

AzDoBoards is to be a tool to assist with project management within Azure DevOps Boards. The UI within Azure DevOps Boards is clunky for doing project management and quickly update information. The intent is to support the hierarchy of Initiative > Epic > Feature > User Story / Bug / Research > Tasks.

This is an idea that has been noodled for a while. Now this is being attempted for future efficiency of project work. We will see where this goes, if anywhere.
